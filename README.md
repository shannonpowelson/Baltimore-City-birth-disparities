# Baltimore City Birth Weight Disparities

## Background
For this analysis, we study disparities in birth weights with respect to variables like household poverty, race, domestic violence, and prenatal care.  According to the article, [Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html) by Linda Villarosa, “black infants are more than twice as likely to die as white infants”.  This is a huge problem that needs to be solved, so we decided to dig a little deeper to explore the variables playing a role in this disparity, specifically in Baltimore City.  Low birth weight is a main [cause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK214473/#:~:text=Low%20birthweight%20is%20a%20major,of%202%2C500%20grams%20or%20less) of infant death.  [Stress](https://www.nature.com/articles/1601526) can cause this low birth rate.  Chronic stress creates health conditions like [hypertension and preeclampsia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html) which can lead to babies being born with low birth weights.  Higher death rates in black infants [can be attributed to weathering](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html), a phenomenon frequently experienced by black women in the United States.  [Weathering](https://www.self.com/story/weathering-and-its-deadly-effect-on-black-mothers) is when racism, both societal and systematic, produces chronic stress in the body.  Therefore, we apply this research to Baltimore City by exploring how satisfactory birth weights are distributed through a series of analyses.  Since we do not have quantitative weathering or racism data, we use household poverty and domestic violence as metrics to measure stress.  Prenatal care has been shown to help pregnant mothers deliver healthy babies, so this metric is also investigated.  Identifying groupings and associations between these variables are essential for advocating for policies that will help to decrease the black infant death rate.
